Basic CRUD application with GoLang at backend, Vue.js at frontend, JWT Authentication


To run server side of application, go to backend directory and run this command: (Deafult port is 8082)
```
go run main.go
```
Or you can just import as a project to your ide and run.



To run client side of application, go to frontend directory and run this command: (Deafult port is 8080)
```
npm run serve
```

Frontend side is not completed therefore it wouldn't work for now.
And also don't forget install node modules by your own.
